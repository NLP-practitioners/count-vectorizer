In physics, gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. 
Gravity is by far the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 10^38 times weaker than the strong interaction, 10^36 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 10^29 times weaker than the weak interaction.
